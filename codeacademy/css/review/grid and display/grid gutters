Grid Gutters
Gutters make up the negative space between columns. This design element helps to provide a natural break between elements aligned horizontally, while also helping to break rows of content vertically.

Note, there will always be one less gutter than the total number of columns. For example, if you are designing on a 12 column grid, then you will only have 11 gutters, one for every gap that separates each column.

While there is no set standard for a gutter width, itâ€™s best practice to select a size that visually separates horizontal columns but is significantly thinner than the width of a column. The same can be said for vertical gutters.

Moreover, vertical and horizontal gutters do not need to match in size for a given grid layout. This is because you as a designer may want more vertical spacing than horizontal spacing when separating elements on a page.

Remember, if the gutter space is too tight, it can be hard to visually tell where one element ends and another starts. On the other hand, if the gutter space is too large, the design can be hard to follow.

Instructions
In the diagram to the right, notice the gutters between each column. The gutter size can vary from project to project but should provide enough space to keep the design feeling natural and allow the user to visually see the separation of content on the page.
