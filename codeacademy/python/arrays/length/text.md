Length
Often, we’ll need to find the number of items in a list, usually called its length.

We can do this using a built-in function called len().

When we apply len() to a list, we get the number of elements in that list:

my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

print(len(my_list))
Would output:

5
Let’s find the length of various lists!

Instructions
1.
Calculate the length of long_list and save it to the variable long_list_len.

2.
Use print() to examine long_list_len.

3.
We have provided a completed range() function for the variable big_range.

Calculate its length using the function len() and save it to a variable called big_range_length.

Note: Range objects do not need to be converted to lists in order to determine their length

4.
Use print() to examine big_range_length.

5.
Change the range() function that generates big_range so that it skips 100 instead of 10 steps between items.

How does this change big_range_length?
