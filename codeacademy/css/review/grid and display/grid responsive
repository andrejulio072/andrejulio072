Responsive Grid
When designing web content, a designer needs to take into account the different screen-sizes a user might encounter and how that will affect a website’s layout. Many websites utilize responsive design, a set of techniques that allow a website’s content to shift based on the device or screen size. Because of these changes, responsive design requires a different number of total columns based on screen size, in order to accommodate content and keep it from being squished.

Consider your mobile, tablet and desktop devices. Now, think about their viewable areas. All are substantially different in size. Thus, it’s common practice in web design to create responsive grid sizes. On a large or desktop device you may start with a 12 column grid, but on a small or mobile device, you adjust the 12 column grid to a 4 column grid.

As a designer, responsive grid design enables you to maximize the content on the screen, ensuring a more accessible experience for users. Additionally, your design elements will have sufficient space to breathe and content can naturally flow across the page.
