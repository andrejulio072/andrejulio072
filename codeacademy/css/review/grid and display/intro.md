Introduction
Grids are made up of intersecting horizontal and vertical lines. For instance, if you look at a city map, you’ll notice streets crossing paths and forming a clear structure to the city’s layout. This is because a lot of them were designed and built using a grid system.

As a designer, grid systems help you organize your designs and provide a series of guidelines to properly align elements on a page. Using this visual layout system can help easily define the space needed between elements, while creating content that guides the user on how to navigate the web page.

Grids can also promote consistency, allowing you to build repeated patterns to carry throughout your designs. Through the use of repetition, the learning curve of using your website can be significantly reduced allowing users to clearly navigate and consume the content.

Let’s explore the different parts of a grid system and discuss how it can help enhance your designs with consistency, alignment, and spacing.
