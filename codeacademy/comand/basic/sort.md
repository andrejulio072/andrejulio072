sort
$ sort continents.txt
sort takes the standard input and orders it alphabetically for the standard output (it doesn’t change the file itself). Here, the continents in continents.txt will be listed in alphabetical order:

Africa
Antarctica
Asia
Australia
Europe
North America
South America
$ cat glaciers.txt | sort > sorted-glaciers.txt
Here, the command takes the standard output from cat glaciers.txt and “pipes” it to sort. The standard output of sort is redirected to a new file named sorted-glaciers.txt.
