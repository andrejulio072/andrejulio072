Tags in HTML
Lesson 1 of 7
Every time you want to create an element on your webpage, you need to use the corresponding HTML tag.

For example, to have a heading element on the page, you can use the h1 tag. A typical tag looks like this.

<h1>Welcome to HTML</h1>

In the above code snippet, you can see that we have wrapped the tag name h1 between the < and > symbols in the opening tag. The end of the element is marked by the closing tag which looks very similar to the opening tag except that it contains an extra / (forward slash).

Some of the most common HTML tags and their purposes are as following.
