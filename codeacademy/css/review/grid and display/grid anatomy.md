Grid Anatomy
When designing a website, the grid comprises three major components: columns, gutters, and margins.

Columns are defined as the vertical sections that span the width of a page. In web design, it’s common to see layouts consisting of 12 or 16 columns, while other may only feature three columns. Defining the number of columns depends on what’s appropriate for your design, device, and or screen viewing size.

Next, a gutter is the negative space between each column. Gutters help in ensuring the columns don’t run together, which would negate the purpose of using a column-based grid.

Margins appear on the left and right sides of the column-based grid. These ensure the content of your designs doesn’t match up to the edges of the browser window.

It’s important to note, margins may vary depending on the width of the grid, browser window, or device. For larger displays, margins may be very noticeable while on smaller screens, they may have the same width as a gutter.
