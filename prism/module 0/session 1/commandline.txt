In this hands-on exercise, you will use the redirection operator. When a redirection operator is used with a command that shows output on the terminal and writes the output in the file specified. Let us see this through an example.

In the terminal, run the following command.
ls -l

We know it shows the detailed view of files in the working directory. Let's store this output in another file. Run the following command to do so.
ls -l > output

You can confirm that redirection worked completely fine by using the cat output command. The output file will be automatically created if not present or created by you.

Let's practice the operator one more time:
man ls > instructions
This command will send the entire manual page to instructions. You can confirm the contents using the cat instructions command.

( >> ) is another redirector that does pretty much the same work but adds the output at the end of the file so that previous content remains intact. Letâ€™s practice it:
whatis ls >> output
Output is added at the end of output. You can confirm it using cat output command.

Congratulations!! You have completed this hands-on exercise.
