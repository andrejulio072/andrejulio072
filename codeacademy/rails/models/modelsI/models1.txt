Models II
What did we just do? Check out the diagram in the browser:

We created three models - Movie, Actor, and Part.
In the models, we used the has_many :through association to connect the Movie model to the Actor model through the Part model.
In this way, the has_many :through association sets up a many-to-many relationship between movies and actors.

Instructions
1.
Now that there’s an association between Movie and Actor, let’s continue and add columns to the migration files:

Open the migration file in db/migrate/ for the movies table, and add the following columns:

a string column called title
a string column called image
a string column called release_year
a string column called plot
Checkpoint 2 Passed
2.
Next in the migration file for the actors table, and add the following columns:

a string column called first_name
a string column called last_name
a string column called image
a string column called bio
Checkpoint 3 Passed
3.
Then in the migration file for the parts table, add the following lines. They add foreign keys that point to the movie and actor tables.

t.belongs_to :movie, index: true 
t.belongs_to :actor, index: true 
Checkpoint 4 Passed
4.
Run the migration to update the database with the three tables.

Checkpoint 5 Passed
5.
Open up db/seeds.rb. We’ve added a few items here to seed the database with movies and actors. Run bundle exec rake db:seed to seed the database with the data in db/seeds.rb.
