Grid Area
We’ve already been able to use grid-row and grid-column as shorthand for properties like grid-row-start and grid-row-end. We can refactor even more using the property grid-area. This property will set the starting and ending positions for both the rows and columns of an item.

.item {
  grid-area: 2 / 3 / 4 / span 5;
}
grid-area takes four values separated by slashes. The order is important! This is how grid-area will interpret those values.

grid-row-start
grid-column-start
grid-row-end
grid-column-end

In the above example, the item will start on row 2 and end on row 4, though the 4th row is not actually included, only rows 2 and 3! The item will then start on column 3 and instead of setting a number for which column to end on, we want this item to span 5 columns — this means the item will include columns 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7.

Using grid-area is an easy way to place items exactly where you want them in a grid.
