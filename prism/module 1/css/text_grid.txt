In this practice session, we are going to learn how to use CSS Grid to create a responsive layout. You will learn to use CSS properties like grid-template-column, grid-template-rows, and grid-gap. 
 
1. Weâ€™ve already done a bit of a setup for you by adding some scaffolding code for you. You have some basic markup in the index.html and some very basic styles in the styles.css file. You can start working directly inside the styles.css file.

2. Add the following style to the container CSS class in styles.css file. This converts the container div into a CSS grid.
.container {
    ...
    display: grid;
}

 

3. Now define the layout of the grid. 
.container {
    ...
    grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr);
    grid-template-rows: repeat(3, 1fr);
}


4. Finally define the grid gap using the grid-gap CSS property.
.container {
    ...
    grid-gap: 10px;
}
 
.item img {
    width: 100%;
    height: auto;
}


Feel free to play around with the CSS grid.
