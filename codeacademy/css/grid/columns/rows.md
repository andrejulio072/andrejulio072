Creating Rows
We’ve learned how to define the number of columns in our grid explicitly. To specify the number and size of the rows, we are going to use the property grid-template-rows.

This property is almost identical to grid-template-columns. Take a look at the code below to see both properties in action.

.grid {
  display: grid;
  width: 1000px;
  height: 500px;
  grid-template-columns: 100px 200px;
  grid-template-rows: 10% 20% 600px;
}
This grid has two columns and three rows. grid-template-rows defines the number of rows and sets each row’s height. In this example, the first row is 50 pixels tall (10% of 500), the second row is 100 pixels tall (20% of 500), and the third row is 600 pixels tall.

When using percentages in these two properties, remember that rows are defined as a percentage of the grid’s height, and columns are defined as a percentage of its width.

By default, the rows are sized to fit evenly inside the grid. Let’s manually change the size of our rows.

In style.css, inside the .grid ruleset, use grid-template-rows to set the first row to be 40% of the grid’s height. Set the second row to be 50% of the grid’s height. And set the third row to be 50px.
