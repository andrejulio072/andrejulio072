Similar to when we were using the break control statement, our continue control statement is usually paired with some form of a conditional (if/elif/else).
When our loop first encountered an element (-1) that met the conditions of the if statement, it checked the code inside the block and saw the continue. When the loop then encounters a continue statement it immediately skips the current iteration and moves onto the next element in the list (4).
The output of the list only printed positive integers in the list because every time our loop entered the if statement and saw the continue statement it simply moved to the next iteration of the list and thus never reached the print statement.
Let’s continue learning about control statements with some exercises!

Instructions

Your computer is the doorman at a bar in a country where the drinking age is 21.

Loop through the ages list. If an entry is less than 21, skip it and move to the next entry. Otherwise, print() the age.
