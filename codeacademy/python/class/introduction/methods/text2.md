Methods with Arguments
Methods can also take more arguments than just self:

class DistanceConverter:
  kms_in_a_mile = 1.609
  def how_many_kms(self, miles):
    return miles * self.kms_in_a_mile

converter = DistanceConverter()
kms_in_5_miles = converter.how_many_kms(5)
print(kms_in_5_miles)
# prints "8.045"
Above we defined a DistanceConverter class, instantiated it, and used it to convert 5 miles into kilometers. Notice again that even though how_many_kms takes two arguments in its definition, we only pass miles, because self is implicitly passed (and refers to the object converter).
