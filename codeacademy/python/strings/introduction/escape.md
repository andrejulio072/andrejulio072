Escape Characters
Occasionally when working with strings, you’ll find that you want to include characters that already have a special meaning in python. For example let’s say I create the string

 favorite_fruit_conversation = "He said, "blueberries are my favorite!""
We’ll have accidentally ended the string before we wanted to by including the " character. The way we can do this is by introducing escape characters. By adding a backslash in front of the special character we want to escape, \", we can include it in a string.

favorite_fruit_conversation = "He said, \"blueberries are my favorite!\""
Now it works!
