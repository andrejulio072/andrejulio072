What Is a CSV File?
Text files aren’t the only thing that Python can read, but they’re the only thing that we don’t need any additional parsing library to understand. CSV files are an example of a text file that impose a structure to their data. CSV stands for Comma-Separated Values and CSV files are usually the way that data from spreadsheet software (like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets) is exported into a portable format. A spreadsheet that looks like the following

Name	Username	Email
Roger Smith	rsmith	wigginsryan@yahoo.com
Michelle Beck	mlbeck	hcosta@hotmail.com
Ashley Barker	a_bark_x	a_bark_x@turner.com
Lynn Gonzales	goodmanjames	lynniegonz@hotmail.com
Jennifer Chase	chasej	jchase@ramirez.com
Charles Hoover	choover	choover89@yahoo.com
Adrian Evans	adevans	adevans98@yahoo.com
Susan Walter	susan82	swilliams@yahoo.com
Stephanie King	stephanieking	sking@morris-tyler.com
Erika Miller	jessica32	ejmiller79@yahoo.com

In a CSV file that same exact data would be rendered like this:

users.csv

Name,Username,Email
Roger Smith,rsmith,wigginsryan@yahoo.com
Michelle Beck,mlbeck,hcosta@hotmail.com
Ashley Barker,a_bark_x,a_bark_x@turner.com
Lynn Gonzales,goodmanjames,lynniegonz@hotmail.com
Jennifer Chase,chasej,jchase@ramirez.com
Charles Hoover,choover,choover89@yahoo.com
Adrian Evans,adevans,adevans98@yahoo.com
Susan Walter,susan82,swilliams@yahoo.com
Stephanie King,stephanieking,sking@morris-tyler.com
Erika Miller,jessica32,ejmiller79@yahoo.com
Notice that the first row of the CSV file doesn’t actually represent any data, just the labels of the data that’s present in the rest of the file. The rest of the rows of the file are the same as the rows in the spreadsheet software, just instead of being separated into different cells they’re separated by… well I suppose it’s fair to say they’re separated by commas.

Instructions
1.
 CSV files are just plain text files!

Open logger.csv using our standard with syntax, saving the file object in the temporary variable log_csv_file.

2.
Print out the contents of logger.csv by calling .read() on the file. Notice that it is parsed as a string.
