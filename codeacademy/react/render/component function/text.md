Apply a Component in a Render Function
This is new territory! You’ve never seen a component rendered by another component before.

You have seen a component rendered before, though, but not by another component. Instead, you’ve seen a component rendered by ReactDOM.render().

When a component renders another component, what happens is very similar to what happens when ReactDOM.render() renders a component.
