Movies I
Nice work! Let’s review what we did:

We added columns to the movies table and actors table
We used the t.belongs_to methods in the parts table to add foreign keys, setting up the many-to-many relationship.
Finally we ran the migrations to update the database, and seeded the database with the data in db/seeds.rb.
