In this hands-on exercise, we will focus on different ways of displaying the contents of a file on the screen.

First, type ls command in the terminal and press Enter to check the contents of the current working directory.
ls
Now, you have seen we have two files named "indian_states_and_ut" and "countries". Let's see the contents of these files. In the terminal write the following commands and press Enter.
cat countries
Here, cat is a command used to view the contents of a file. You can see it in the output of a command. Let’s view the content of one more file.
cat indian_states_and_ut
Now, you can see the content of 'indian_states_and_ut' file, but this file has too much information. To see the content on a single screen, write the following command in the terminal and press Enter.
less indian_states_and_ut
 Now, you can see the contents on one page at a time. You can move by pressing the up and down keys. Type q to exit.

Now, to view some top lines of a file, write the following command in the terminal and press Enter.
head indian_states_and_ut
Here, head command is used to view the first 10 lines of a file, as you can see in the output.

You can also select the number of lines you want to see from the beginning of the file using the following command.
head -5 indian_states_and_ut
You can change the number after (–) to view more or fewer lines as per your need.

Similarly, if you want to see the contents from the ending, you can use the tail command.
tail indian_states_and_ut
You can use the optional command (–) to see the specific number of lines.

As you can see in your output, there is no line number. You can specify it using the nl commands.
nl countries
nl indian_states_and_ut
 Here, nl command displays numbers before the line.

Congratulations!! You have completed this hands-on exercise.
