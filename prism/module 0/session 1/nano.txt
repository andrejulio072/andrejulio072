In this hands-on exercise, you will practice how to use the nano editor.

First, check the content of the working directory.
ls
 Now, let's go into the practice directory by using the following command.
cd practice
 nano is an easy-to-use command line text editor for Linux operating systems. It includes all the basic functionality you would expect from a vim editor. To launch the nano editor, type the following command in the editor and press Enter.
nano
 You will see a little easy and graphic-based interface.

There are many options given at the bottom of the screen.

^ symbol means you have to press ctrl before pressing any alphabet to execute the commands written after them.

In the editor space, you can write any content. To save the file, press Ctrl + O.
Ctrl + O
It will prompt you to write a file name in your current directory. Type the file name, say prototype1 or give a new name. Now you have created a new file using the nano editor. So simple, is it?

Similarly, editing a file using the nano editor is also easy. Type the following command to open the file in the nano editor.
nano prototype1
 This will open the file in the nano editor, and now you can edit the file as you want. All the other commands also work same as vim editor.

Congratulations!! You have completed this hands-on exercise.
