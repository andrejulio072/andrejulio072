Font Weight
In CSS, the font-weight property controls how bold or thin text appears. It can be specified with keywords or numerical values.

Keyword Values
The font-weight property can take any one of these keyword values:

bold: Bold font weight.
normal: Normal font weight. This is the default value.
lighter: One font weight lighter than the element’s parent value.
bolder: One font weight bolder than the element’s parent value
Numerical Values
Numerical values can range from 1 (lightest) to 1000 (boldest), but it is common practice to use increments of 100. A font weight of 400 is equal to the keyword value normal, and a font weight of 700 is equal to bold.

.left-section {
  font-weight: 700;
}

.right-section {
  font-weight: bold;
}
In the example above, text in elements of both .left-section and .right-section classes will appear bold.

It’s important to note that not all fonts can be assigned a numeric font weight, and not all numeric font weights are available to all fonts. It’s a good practice to look up the font you are using to see which font-weight values are available.
